# Medical Question Bank
MedQuizet is a comprehensive medical question bank that provides over 2000 questions from all the major courses in medical school, including 10+ Ethiopian medical school university questions. Plus, we add 100+ new questions every week to keep the content fresh and relevant.

To build MedQuizet, I used cutting-edge technologies such as React JS for client-side development, Material UI 5 for styling, Node JS for server-side, and MySQL for database management.

Whether you're a medical student looking to ace your exams or a healthcare professional looking to brush up on your knowledge, MedQuizet has something for everyone. Check it out today at medquizet.com and let me know what you think!
